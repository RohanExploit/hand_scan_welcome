Hand Scanner 
Hand scanner gimmik Meme inspiration by @DanangKumara. 

This was my project wheb an Indonesia  Principal , touched a television screen with the outline of a handprint, as if the television was scanning his hand. However, the screen didn't have a touch screen function, and the animation that played after he "scanned" his hand was shown to be a video after the video player UI accidentally appeared when he touched it.So we use CV2 and with Camera we have scanned the Palm of Guest so that our system welcomes the Guest of honour
